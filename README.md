# Predicting-Data
This code is used to predict daily bike rental ridership. The dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012.

# Spliting Data
The number of riders is split between casual and registered.Here we have some categorical variables like season, weather, month. 

# Dummy Variables
To include these in our model, we'll need to make binary dummy variables.

# Scaling Target
To make training the network easier, we'll standardize each of the continuous variables. That is, we'll shift and scale the variables such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.

# Building network
The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is  ùëì(ùë•)=ùë• . A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs to the neurons on the next layer. This process is called forward propagation.

We use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural network. We use the weights to also propagate error backwards from the output back into the network to update our weights. This is called backpropagation.

# Training the network
The strategy here is to find hyperparameters such that the error on the training set is low, but you're not overfitting to the data. If you train the network too long or have too many hidden nodes, it can become overly specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the validation set. That is, the loss on the validation set will start increasing as the training set loss drops.
